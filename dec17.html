To begin this lesson, everyone's created in Gods image, which is said in Genesis 1:27 (“So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them”). Along with this, everyone is also on their own path, with unique life experiences that reflect what they have been through. No matter how low you are feeling on this path, the Lord has a path for us, he has plans for us to prosper and plans to give us hope and a future, which is written in Jeremiah 29:11 (“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”)

Along with his plans, he wants us to spread the gospel. In 1 Peter 4:10, it is said “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.” He wants us to use our unique gifts we have to share Gods words to others. He wants us all to go out and teach others about what He has said, which is further shown in Eph 2:10 “For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” 

No matter what point we are at, how low we are, God has a great amount of love for us. (Lamentations 3:22-24) (“Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. I say to myself, “The Lord is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.”)Even when times seem troubling, stay faithful, as his purpose for you will be delivered. We have been called according to his great plan, and as stated earlier, we have been called to share his word. 

To conclude the lesson, the Lord has a great plan for us, and he has called us according to this plan. He will guide us through this plan (Proverbs 3:6) (“in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.”) and this plan will give you hope and have a future.</p>
